# Urbit Avatars
An avatar function

## Commands
`yarn` can be substituted for `npm` if you want to have a bad time.

|Commands              | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
|`$ yarn start`        | Start development server                      |
|`$ yarn build`        | Create a build                                |

## How this works
I don't know yet. But something like `patp => ? => svg`

## How to use this
This is a debug and dev utility for making the function that generates an avatar.
